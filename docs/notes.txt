** LINUX USER'S GUIDE (from pre-built packages)
* Make sure you're using the latest released version of ANT+minus.
* Make sure that the cp210x kernel module is loaded: "sudo modprobe cp210x". Verify by looking at non-empty output of "lsmod | grep cp210x".
* Make sure that the USB2ANT stick is connected to the machine.
* Make sure cp210x driver was assigned to your USB2ANT. Verify by "dmesg | grep tty" and look for a line similar to: "[ 3274.854726] usb 6-2: cp210x converter now attached to ttyUSB0". Also make sure "ls /dev/ttyUSB*" lists your device node.
* Your user must be able to access the /dev/ttyUSB0 device. This can be achieved e.g. by the installing the http://antpm.googlecode.com/git/scripts/80-ant-stick.rules udev rule into /etc/udev/rules.d . Restart udev. Verify by "cat /dev/ttyUSB0".
* Install the antpm binary package.
* Enable "pairing mode" on your watch.
* Bring your watch to ~50cm from the USB2ANT stick. Sometimes avoiding the proximity of a WiFi network helps.
* Run "antpm-downloader" on your machine. This will attempt connecting to the watch and pair with it first.
* During pairing, you have to click "Yes" on the watch to complete pairing.
* Afterwards all activity information from the watch is downloaded to your machine. This can take some time.
* The downloaded files are stored on your machine to the folder ConfigFolder/*device-id*/*current-date-time* (where ConfigFolder equals $XDG_CONFIG_HOME which usually points to $HOME/.config/antpm/ or $ANTPM_DIR/ if that is set).
* The 310XT stores all information in .fit files. These files can describe waypoints/tracks/activities.
* To convert the downloaded .fit files to a more commonly used .gpx format, issue the command "antpm-fit2gpx -F ConfigFolder/*device-id*/*current-date-time*" e.g. "antpm-fit2gpx -F ~/.config/antpm/4531082473/2013_03_26_10_58_19". This will populate the given folder with .gpx files.


** HOW TO SUBMIT A BUG-REPORT
* Please open a bug report at http://code.google.com/p/antpm/issues/list
* In your report please include:
*  The log of the program in question. This is usually saved under ~/.config/antpm
*  What steps will reproduce the problem?
*  What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
*  What version of ANT+minus are you using? On what operating system? Is it pre-built of from sources?
*  What GPS are you trying to use? What firmware version?


** WINDOWS USER'S GUIDE (from pre-built packages)
* Make sure that the USB2ANT stick is connected to the machine.
* Install the libusb driver by running "3rd_party/libusb-win32-bin-1.2.6.0/driver_installer/inf-wizard.exe"
