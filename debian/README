	HOWTO USE garmin-ant-downloader

1. plugin your ANT+ stick
2. the system will load the kernel module "cp210x"
3. to find out what ttyUSB device is used run

   # dmesg|grep "cp210x converter"
   [...] cp210x 3-1:1.0: cp210x converter detected
   [...] usb 3-1: cp210x converter now attached to ttyUSB3

   In this case you have to use the optione "-d 3". If it is
   ttyUSB0 then you don't need the -d option because 0 is the
   default
4. put the watch into paring mode (menu -> configuration -> ANT+ ->
   computer -> pairing on)
5. pair the computer with the watch ("mywatch" as name for the watch and
   the file "auth405" as an authorization file which will be created)

   # garmin-ant-downloader -d 3 -f mywatch -a auth405

6. download saved tracks from the watch

   # garmin-ant-downloader -d 3 -f mywatch -nza auth405


You get the possible options with

   # garmin-ant-downloader -h

To convert the downloaded TCX file (e.g. 2011-07-22-123456.tcx) you can use gpsbabel:

   # gpsbabel -t -i gtrnctr -f 2011-07-22-123456.tcx -o gpx -F 2011-07-22-123456.gpx
